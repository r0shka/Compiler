# About
Our goal is to make an L to MIPS compiler. What is L? L is a made up simplified programming language, which we are using because of time restriction. Examples of L code can be found in "test" folder. Names of the variables and functions are in french, so are the comments. Project is purely educative, so you are free to use this code.
# How to
Compile with "make", and launch "./comp".
