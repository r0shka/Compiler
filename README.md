# About
Our goal is to make an L to MIPS compilator. What is L? L is a made up simplified programming language, which we are using because of time restriction. Names of the variables and functions are in french, so are the comments. Project is purely educative, so you are free to use the code.
# How to
Compile: make
Launch: ./comp
